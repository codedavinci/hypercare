## Considerations

- **Fake Delay**: There is a simulated 2-second delay added to display the loading state UI (skeleton cards) for a better user experience. This delay is implemented to mimic real-world scenarios where data fetching might take some time.

- **In-Memory Pagination**: Since the API does not support pagination, an in-memory pagination approach is used. The `View More` button fetches all the data at once, and pagination is managed locally to display a limited number of elements at a time.

- **Data Fetching**: Due to the large dataset (2000 elements) returned by the API, data fetching is performed only once during the initial load. Subsequent actions such as viewing user details or paginating through the data are managed in memory without additional API calls.

These considerations are important for understanding the behavior of the application and its limitations when working with real-world data and API integrations.
